/*/*
As for the connection to database, I have created a “connection.php” file specifying the four parameters that are needed for a database connection which includes Host, followed by the Username, then Password and finally the Database name. In this case as the connection is done using XAMPP, the host, username, password and database name are “localhost”, “root”, ““, and “admin” respectively and stored in $con variable.*/
